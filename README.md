# ProjectDDoS
After 4 years, I have chosen to continue this in python instead of Java. This will mostly be made from scratch as the old code is old and in a separate langauge.


## Note:
While this is open source, I reserve all rights of this software and code. This is planned to become a commercial product and I will treat this project as such. If you wish to use this for inspiration or use excerpts for projects not related to this, feel free, but do not create copies or clones of this work
